 I am 120875ABAB, Intermediate Operator for GOD. If you read this, it is because you want to know more about me. Things I like are pictures of animals, logic puzzles and computers. I dislike fizzy drinks, wearing my necktie and boring colors. I hope to become a senior GOD operator one day. As an employee of the Corporation, I believe in our power to succeed. It was nice talking to you, goodbye!
