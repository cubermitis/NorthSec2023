# ATM Network 01

We get a message on notepad.exe.nsec saying:

> Found an unusual system in the logs: atm01.bank.ctf
> Seems connected to www.bank.ctf - Should investigate.
> 
> WTH is an ATM?

We then nmap atm01.bank.ctf:
```console
root@ctn-shell:~# nmap -6 -Pn atm01.bank.ctf
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-05-23 19:45 UTC

An exposed VNC server! Let's connect and find out what awaits us on the other side.

We got the first flag of the track: `Bank Network 1/8` worth 1 point.
